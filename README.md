# Model Predictive Control Project
## Control of a quadcopter

### Description
<!--- Modify this section --->
This project aims to control a quadcopter through model predictive control methods. The first approach is by a linearization of the system and the second approach use non-linear model predictive control.
At the end of the project, it was noticed that the second approach reach better performances, yet the computations take more time then the linearization method.




### Getting Started
<!--- Modify this section --->
This version was designed for Matlab 2020a or higher. To run the code for each deliverable, go in the desired folder and launch the corresponding Deliverable m-file.

### Prerequisites

#### Libraries
The following libraries are used:
* [YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/) R20200930, available through the installation of MPT3
* [Casadi](https://web.casadi.org/get/) v3.5.5 for Matlab
* [MPT3](https://www.mpt3.org/Main/Installation): run [install_mpt3.m](https://www.mpt3.org/Main/Installation?action=download&upname=install_mpt3.m) in Matlab
* [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/): download `Gurobi Optimizer`


#### Code 
<!--- Modify this section --->
Each folder corresponds to the deliverable name.
